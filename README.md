# React app that acts as a section of a video game website

Task part of Udacity's React nano degree program.

Requirements:

- Add a user's first name, last name, and username.
- When the user is added, the number of games that he/she has played defaults to 0.
- Each username has to be unique, so we cannot add multiple users with the same username.
- When someone clicks "Add" but the username already exists, the app should not allow for a duplicate user to be added and should show an error message instead.
- The app should also display a list of users, specifically their usernames and the number of games they've played (which is defaulted to 0).
- If someone tries to add a user when one of the fields is empty, the "Add" button should be disabled.
- We should also have a button that lets us toggle between showing and hiding the number of games the users have played. For example, the button can start out as "Hide the Number of Games Played" and the app can display "username1 played 0 games." Clicking that button should change the button text to "Show the Number of Games Played" and the displayed username and score can be changed to "username1 played \* games."

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
